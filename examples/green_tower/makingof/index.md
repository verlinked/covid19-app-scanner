## Making of: The 'Green Tower'

On this page, we are showing the complete process of making the 'Green Tower' COVID-19 App Scanner device as an example.

|:-:|:-:|
| ![3D Printer on duty](../media/greentower-makingof-01.jpg) | Printing the shell for the device. The 3D printer is printing the bottom part of the 'Green Tower'. |
| Put threaded inserts into the openings. This allows the screws to be loosened and tightened as often as required. | ![Insert threaded inserts](../media/greentower-makingof-02.jpg) |
| ![The ESP32](../media/greentower-makingof-03.jpg) | This is the ESP32. The Covid-19 App Scanner is installed. |
| Screw the ESP32 into the case. The screws fit perfectly into the printed openings. | ![Install the ESP32](../media/greentower-makingof-04.jpg) |
| ![Check the power cable](../media/greentower-makingof-05.jpg) | Feed the power cable through the opening provided and connect it to the ESP32. |
| That's all for the bottom part of the 'Green Tower'. Next prepare the LED-Strip for the top part of the case. | ![Bottom done](../media/greentower-makingof-06.jpg) |
| ![Solder a cable to the LEDs](../media/greentower-makingof-07.jpg) | Solder a short cable to the LED-strip. |
| This is the top of the 'Green Tower' containing an opening for the LED-strip. | ![Top of the case](../media/greentower-makingof-09.jpg) |
| ![Install the LED-strip](../media/greentower-makingof-10.jpg) | The LED-Strip fits perfectly into the 3D printed top. |
| Use duct tape to keep the LED-strip in place. | ![Attach the LEDs](../media/greentower-makingof-11.jpg) |
| ![Connect the ESP32 and the LEDs](../media/greentower-makingof-13.jpg) | Plug the LED-Strip into the ESP32 and shut the case. |
| Finally connected: Top and bottom parts of the tower. | ![Prototype finished](../media/greentower-makingof-14.jpg) |
| ![Customize](../media/greentower-makingof-16.jpg) | We customized the 'Green Tower' with the Logo of our company as well as the official logo of the Corona-Warn-App. |
| The COVID-19 App Scanner in action: All lights green: Corona-Warn-App on a device nearby found. | ![Corona-Warn-App found](../media/greentower-makingof-18.jpg) |
| ![No Corona-Warn-App found](../media/greentower-makingof-19.jpg) | All lights red: No Corona-Warn-App found. |
