title: The COVID-19 App Scanner Project
---

# The Idea

Imagine a device that helps to identify people having the Corona-Warn-App
installed on their smartphones. This could be useful in various scenarios.

For example, a party location where only people get access having the app on
their phones. Or giving people a free drink when they have the app
active and running. Or implement a counter to detect more than one smartphone
at a time.

# Example

The first example of a COVID-19 App Scanner device is the
[Green Tower](examples/green_tower) made by
[verlinked](https://www.verlinked.com).
